Project:


My goal for this project is to explore the startup investment world and conduct analysis to answer this 4 main categories:

I will check how investments have been evolving over time and what type of companies were most popular within each year

I will conduct a deeper analysis of company types and use T-test analysis to compare fundings for some of these company types.

I will also conduct a deeper analysis of Startup locations and how they compare in term of fundings. I will use T-test analysis to compare company type fundings within different locations.

I will look at companies that were acquired only, what they may have in common and how their types compare.
